The goal of this project is to improve upon an existing design for a four-legged Arduino robot.  By attaching a smartphone to the body, it should be possible to send commands via Bluetooth to the robot to cause it to move based on what it sees.

Hopefully this gives a sense of the amount of experimentation and trouble-shooting involved:
