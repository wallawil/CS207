Hello, reader!  This Readme file will attempt to walk you through my Human-Tracking Creepy Robot project.

Click here for the quick-start guide.  This guide is appropriate for advanced users who have done some preliminary work.

Click here for an in-depth guide on building this project from nothing.




Quick-start Guide:

Preliminary work:
Build the robot and circuit
Pair the HC-05 with your smartphone
Upload the Human-Tracking Creepy Robot sketch to your Arduino
Install the Arduino Object Tracking app to your phone

Activating the robot:
Supply power to your Arduino
Open ArdObject Tracking app on your phone
Attach the phone to the cell phone holder

The robot will now follow humans.



In-depth Guide:

Use your material of choice to create the robot's body and legs.  For this project, a 3D printer was used.  You may use another material if you prefer.

**You can view the diary logs for a step-by-step commentary of my successes and many failures.**
**The diary entries have way more detail; this readme is more of a splash page for the time being.**

The goal of this project is to improve upon an existing design for a four-legged Arduino robot.  By attaching a smartphone to the body, it should be possible to send commands via Bluetooth to the robot to cause it to move based on what it sees.

Hopefully this gives a sense of the amount of experimentation and trouble-shooting involved:
