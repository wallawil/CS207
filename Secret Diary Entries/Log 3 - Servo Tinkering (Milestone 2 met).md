## Servo Tinkering

### I.
I ordered two servos from Solarbotics.com.  
The company ships out of Calgary and the parts got here fast.\
The servo model is GWS S03N.\

### II.
I have a lot to learn about servos.\
Things to keep in mind:\
Reset to position 90 when you want a nice horizontal midpoint.\
The granularity of the gears of the servo may not make things perfectly straight.\
For example, depending on how the servos are attached, position 90 might be slightly forward or back, rather than perfectly level.


### III.
The walk pattern is off-center a bit.  It gradually curves to the left.\
If the robot is eventually able to correct its path, e.g. by spotting a human off to the right, then this might be okay.\
However, ideally, it would be best if he walked in a straight line until needing to deviate.\
This would remove a need for constant corrections.\
Also, the robot will probably move more slowly if it is constantly correcting.  Moving in a straight line is fastest.\
Goal:  Do it right and avoid corrections.\
Easier said than done.\

### IV.
I should mention that the 3D printing seems to have gone well.\
I could not find a preexisting 3D object but there was a PDF which of course just contained a 2D image.\
However, in Autodesk Fusion 360, it was fairly simple to extrude the 2D shapes into 3D objects.\
It might be a tight fit.  My main concern was the servos wouldn't fit, because I wasn't sure of their dimensions.
