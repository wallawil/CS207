## Servo Tinkering

### I.
I ordered two servos from Solarbotics.com.  The company ships out of Calgary and the parts got here fast.
The servo model is GWS S03N.

### II.
I have a lot to learn about servos.
Things to keep in mind:
Reset to position 90 when you want a nice horizontal midpoint.
The granularity of the gears of the servo may not make things perfectly straight.
For example, depending on how the servos are attached, position 90 might be slightly forward or back, rather than perfectly level.
