## Bluetooth Triumphs
### I.
I have met my first milestone with a bit of time to spare.\
*I was able to get my smartphone to control a LED on the Arduino.*

Woop woop!

This required some voltage division using my limited selection of resistors.\
The ARDX comes with about a million 560 ohm resistors, so that's what I used.

A big unnecessary delay was having my LED backwards on the breadboard.\
I thought my Bluetooth or sketch was faulty, but it was the circuit itself.\
In my defense, I had followed an online tutorial which itself was slightly inaccurate.

In a sense, there is no such thing as an unnecessary delay.\
Every delay is a necessary step to be overcome.

Mistakes are an opportunity for learning.\
Ego is an invitation for meditation.\
Ego is a mistake - a necessary mistake towards growth.
